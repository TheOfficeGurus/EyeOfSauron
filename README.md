# The Eye – Centralized Total Monitoring System

> *"A single lidless eye, wreathed in flame, fixed upon the network. It does not blink. It does not sleep. It sees all."*

**The Eye** is a centralized monitoring system inspired by the omniscience of the *Eye of Sauron*, designed to oversee in real time the status, resources, and updates of multiple Windows computers across an organization.

## Key Features of "The Eye"

### Constant Surveillance

- Every Windows machine becomes a **watched tower**.
- Collects metrics like **CPU**, **RAM**, **disk space**, **active processes**, and **network usage**.
- Tracks **OS updates**, **antivirus status**, and **patch compliance**.

### Omniscient Presence

- "The Eye" never blinks: a **central dashboard** shows the real-time health of all devices.
- **Immediate alerts** for failures, overloads, offline systems, or security anomalies.

## Final Metaphor

> *Just as Sauron poured his will into a flaming eye fixed on domination, this system channels the vision of IT into a single interface. Each computer is a piece on the board. Each anomaly, a spark that ignites a warning. And while the eye is open—nothing escapes.*
